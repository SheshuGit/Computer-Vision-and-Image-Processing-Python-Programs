## Introduction
This repository contains a series of projects that illustrate the application of computer vision and image processing using Python. 
These projects are designed for educational purposes and can be used as a reference or starting point for your own projects.

## Features
- Implementation of basic image processing techniques
- Application of computer vision algorithms
- Use of popular libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-image
- Example projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SheshuGit/Computer-Vision-and-Image-Processing-Python-Programs.git
cd Computer-Vision-and-Image-Processing-Python-Programs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

## Usage
Each project is contained within its own directory. Navigate to the desired project folder and run the main script to see the project in action.

```bash
cd project-name
python main.py
```
